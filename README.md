Coding Test

No of Projects in the solution
1. API Project
2. Xunit Test Project

I've added an API and integrated swagger to test API. An API will accept string and returns the first longest subsequence.
I've added all the test cases included in the code test.

The docker-compose file includes the api service and it will excute the docker compose test that will return the number of test cases paased and failed.
